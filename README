Hey there.

This is 'groceree_server', the backend to my Android app, Groceree. This is my first time trying
something of this scale with NodeJS, so it's probably terrible. I'm sorry about that.

This is an API server that maintains a list of grocery items. The implementation is pretty simple and
naive, but it's taught me a lot. These are the specifics:

Method: GET
    /list
        Sends all 'active' items, meaning rows from the 'item' database whose 'isDeleted' value is false.
        The requester should expect a response payload of the form:

        {
            'timestamp': <unix timestamp>,
            'items': [
                {
                    'id': <object id string>,
                    'item': <item name string>,
                    'isMarked': <isMarked boolean>,
                    'isDeleted': <isDeleted boolean>,
                    'timestamp': <Unix timestamp>,
                    'version': <version integer>
                },
                {
                    ...
                },
                {
                    ...
                }
            ]
        }

        Where <unix timestamp> is in epoch time marked at the moment the response is sent.

Method: POST
    /syncItems
        Given a payload of a Unix timestamp and array of item objects, the server adds new items to the database,
        and updates existing items if the payload item object is 'newer'; 'newer' meaning it has a version number greater
        or equal to that of the server's existing item.
        
        The payload should be of the form:

        {
            'timestamp': <unix timestamp>,
            'items': [
                {
                    'id': <object id string>,
                    'item': <item name string>,
                    'isMarked': <isMarked boolean>,
                    'isDeleted': <isDeleted boolean>,
                    'timestamp': <Unix timestamp>,
                    'version': <version integer>
                },
                {
                    ...
                },
                {
                    ...
                }
            ]
        }

        Upon receipt of such a payload, the server will update its item list accordingly, and then send a response
        with a payload of all items, new and existing, that have changed since the timestamp sent in the request payload.
        The form will be the same as that of the '/list' endpoint.
